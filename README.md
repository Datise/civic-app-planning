# Project Overview
MH - must have

## What is it? 

  A mixed medium, cross platform communication platform that aims to facilitate municipal growth and citizen participation by providing an accesible modernized civil feedback loop.
## Core Parts
- city facing
  * A web dashboard where city planners can accomplish their user stories (found in the user story document)
- other organization facing (stretch goal):
  * A web dashboard where non-profits and other organizations can get feedback on their plans or events around the city. (must municipal level)
- citizen facing
  * A web dashboard where citizens can see and respond to proposals orchestrated by city planners and other people/organizations.
  * A mobile application where citizens can see smaller or subsections of the propsal on the go, and get updates when proposals change direction or have minimum levels of feedback. 

## Goals
* Help cities with policy or change construction, in return making it more transparent for citizens.
* Present/Enforce a standardized presentation format for municpal changes and policy thats equally tansparent, accessible, and fair to all parties involved.
* Help remove marginalization barriers, and increase accesibility in civic participation.
* Increase participation quantity by providing a modern medium to civic participation.
* Help cities develop policy and interact effectively with larger portions of its populous, but using insights provided by AI integrations and analytical insights.
* Reduce cost of municipal decisions
* Increase flexibility of municipal decisions.
* Have at least 10% of each area giving regular feedback.

## Ethics

* All data must be 'open' & anonymized and made available to the city/other public research uses, perhaps private research uses on a case by case basis.
* Use of demographical/personal data and responses must be transparent and opt-outable
* Never intentionally moderate or influence the outcome of polls


##Presentation structures (from the municipalities perspective) * General

1. Cities should present changes categorically and in a 'post' format, with major updates pushing posts back to the most recent. 
(Details of each category in their own sectios)
2. Proposed topic categories are:
  1. Zoning changes and building developments.
  2. Changes to social code, with options for being area or region specific (such as beach laws vs park laws vs drinking districts etc. ).
  4. Changes to municipal/regional tax law.
  5. Changes to investment/financing of social programs.

## the motives of citizens should be to have their voice heard and contribute the decisions made in their city
## the motivation of cities is to have a more cheaper and more effective platform then running studies or paying for private groups to poll public opinion
