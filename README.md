# Project Overview
MH - must have

## What is it? 

  A mixed medium communication platform that aims to facilitate municipal growth and citizen participation by providing an accesible modernized civil feedback loop. 

## Goals

* Present/Enforce a standardized presentation format for municpal changes and policy thats equally tansparent, accessible, and fair to all parties involved.
* Help remove marginalization barriers, and increase accesibility in civic participation.
* Increase quantity by providing a modern medium to civic participation.
* Help cities interact effectively with larger portions of its populous, but using insights provided by AI integrations and analytical insights.

## Ethics

* All data must be 'open' * anonymized and made available to the city/other public research uses, perhaps private research uses on a case by case basis.
* Use of demographical/personal data and responses must be transparent and opt*outable
* Never intentionally moderate or influence the outcome of polls

##Things still up in the air:

* Best ways to organize each category (if different)
* Required information for each category
* BIG GAP: Are citizens allowed to create topics/get support for initives (yes, but), Are there topic restrictions? What are the requirements? Is there fact checking? What/is there moderation? 

##Presentation structures (from the municipalities perspective) * General

1. Cities should present changes categorically and in a 'post' format, with major updates pushing posts back to the most recent. 
(Details of each category in their own sectios)
2. Proposed topic categories are:
  1. Zoning changes and building developments.
  2. Changes to social code, with options for being area or region specific (such as beach laws vs park laws vs drinking districts etc. ).
  4. Changes to municipal/regional tax law.
  5. Changes to investment/financing of social programs.

## the motives of citizens should be to have their voice heard and contribute the decisions made in their city
## the motivation of cities is to have a more cheaper and more effective platform then running studies or paying for private groups to poll public opinion
