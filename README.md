#Project Overview
MH - must have

##What is it? 
  A mixed medium communication platform that aims to facilitate municipal growth and citizen participation by providing an accesible, low barrier, modernized feedback loop. 
##Goals
* Present/Enforce a standardized presentation format for municpal changes and policy thats equally tansparent, accessible, and fair to all parties involved.
* Help remove marginalization barriers, and increase accesibility in civic participation.
* Increase quantity by providing a modern medium to civic participation.
* Help cities interact effectively with larger portions of its populous, but using insights provided by AI integrations and analytical insights.

## ETHICS
* All data must be 'open' * anonymized and made available to the city/other public research uses, perhaps private research uses on a case by case basis.
* Use of demographical/personal data and responses must be transparent and opt*outable
* Never intentionally moderate or influence the outcome of polls


## the motives of citizens should be to have their voice heard and contribute the decisions made in their city
## the motivation of cities is to have a more cheaper and more effective platform then running studies or paying for private groups to poll public opinion

##Things still up in the air:
* best ways to organize each category (if different)
* required information for each category
* BIG GAP: Are citizens allowed to create topics/get support for initives (yes, but), Are there topic restrictions? What are the requirements? Is there fact checking? What/is there moderation? 

##Presentation structures (from the municipalities perspective) * General

1. Cities should present changes categorically and in a 'post' format, with major updates pushing posts back to the most recent. 
(Details of each category in their own sectios)
2. Proposed topic categories are:
  1. Zoning changes and building developments.
  2. Changes to social code, with options for being area or region specific (such as beach laws vs park laws vs drinking districts etc. ).
  4. Changes to municipal/regional tax law.
  5. Changes to investment/financing of social programs.


### Zoning changes and building developments.
####from the city
 When a city wishes to change the zoning of a major lot or section of a neighbourhood, and they want feedback to the decision or have to collect public feedback before continuing, they can create a building proposition post. It should have the following:
  * Previous zoning, and with references to what the building codes mean.
  * if available/legal, previous owners or operators
  * information on any organization operating out of its space in the last 5 years (perhaps only legal if a publicly funded one)
  * If changes in housing, the average income/some basic (anonymous) demographical information on the previous residence
  * Publicly available information regarding the physical health of the building
####from the people
  * People should short and long form thoughts on the issue
####from the application
  * The application should be able to separate out how people feel about the change to their neighbourhood (sentiment analysis)
  * The application should be able to provide a general analysis wether locals are for (with/without conditions) or against (paraphrased reasons) the change in buildings. 
  * CAN/SHOULD The application should prioritize people who live in the same neighbourhood/riding above people from the rest of the city?
  * (if possible) The application should be able to aggregate the "yes with condition" responses or the "no because x reason" responses into counter propositions
  * possible technologies used: swarm intelligence, sentiment analysis, paraphrasing (for long form against answers), similarity of idea comparison

###Changes to social code
####from the city
  When a city wishes to change matters of social policy they should:
  * Provide the current policy
    * MH explanation of what the policy was hoping to accomplish(it's purpose)
    * MH proof, statistical or otherwise, as to why the current policy is ineffective, OR, predictive/example statistics about what how a new policy should improve its outcome.
    * The motivation behind the change in policy (is it being changed because change has been requested or because statistics show it's not working)
  * Provide the new policy
    * If adapted from a different municipality, it should have examples and information of the new policy working elsewhere
