# What questions should be answerable?
### City Perspective
*All questions should be separable by demographic*

* What percentage of local/regional residents support/reject this proposal?
* What is the emotional response to this proposal?
* What are their specific issues with the proposal?
(all through probably acheivable through Watson's AlchemyLanguage api)
If negative:
  * What changes are preferable to the parties involved?
* what is the pro's/con's of a decision based on x factor (trade off analytics)

### Citizen Perspective
* What changes are coming into my neighbourhood?
* What changes are coming to my city?
* How does my city rank on transparency?
* Where does my city get its inspiration for policy? 
* Does my city propose benefits to things I care about?
* Is my city changing in ways that I prioritize?
