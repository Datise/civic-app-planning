CTs - constituents
PPs - proposals
### As a city I want to:
- create PPs
- edit PPs
- notify CTs when PPs have changed
- see what makes successfull PPs
- poll CTs for feedback on PPs
- see how CTs feel about PPs
- see paraphrased feedback/suggestions for improvement about PPs
  - see how broadly suggestions are shared by constituencies
- see demographical and regional break down of feedback.
- possibly use the website as the means to create and share reports

### As a CT I want to:
- see PPs in my neighbourhood
- see PPs in my city
- search PPs by category
- see the information and statistics that are backing the PP 
- see good ideas, and general thoughts shared by other CTs
- rank PPs based on how accessible the information is to me
- discuss the impact of PPs amongst my community
- see similar PPs and policy in other cities, interact with those citizens (but not respond directly to PPs of that city)
- register/signup relative to my city
- be able to 'move' (restriction on responding to cities you don't live in, or atleast not be counted when commenting on other 'cities')
