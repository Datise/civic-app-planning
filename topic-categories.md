# Zoning changes and building developments.
##from the city
 When a city wishes to change the zoning of a major lot or section of a neighbourhood, and they want feedback to the decision or have to collect public feedback before continuing, they can create a building proposition post. It should have the following:
  * Previous zoning, and with references to what the building codes mean.
  * if available/legal, previous owners or operators
  * information on any organization operating out of its space in the last 5 years (perhaps only legal if a publicly funded one)
  * If changes in housing, the average income/some basic (anonymous) demographical information on the previous residence
  * Publicly available information regarding the physical health of the building
####from the people
  * People should short and long form thoughts on the issue
####from the application
  * The application should be able to separate out how people feel about the change to their neighbourhood (sentiment analysis)
  * The application should be able to provide a general analysis wether locals are for (with/without conditions) or against (paraphrased reasons) the change in buildings. 
  * CAN/SHOULD The application should prioritize people who live in the same neighbourhood/riding above people from the rest of the city?
  * (if possible) The application should be able to aggregate the "yes with condition" responses or the "no because x reason" responses into counter propositions
  * possible technologies used: swarm intelligence, sentiment analysis, paraphrasing (for long form against answers), similarity of idea comparison

#Changes to social code
##from the city
  When a city wishes to change matters of social policy they should:
  * Provide the current policy
    * MH explanation of what the policy was hoping to accomplish(it's purpose)
    * MH proof, statistical or otherwise, as to why the current policy is ineffective, OR, predictive/example statistics about what how a new policy should improve its outcome.
    * The motivation behind the change in policy (is it being changed because change has been requested or because statistics show it's not working)
  * Provide the new policy
    * If adapted from a different municipality, it should have examples and information of the new policy working elsewhere
