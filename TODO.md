# To Do
## Use Case Perspective
* Find professional consultation on the inner workings of municipal changes and policy.
* Determine if the supposed use case for cities is actually worth while.
  * How much do they actually spend on polling/feedback?
  * What level of insights are they currently getting from the population? How long does it take to piece together the data, analyze etc.
  * Are they locked under contracts or what is the current contract structure for public polling organizations. 
* Run a little poll to determine if there is interest in a new platform of communication for the citizenship perspective.
* Look for other polling/census organizations or institutions and determine if this should be built topic indifferent. (other use cases then intended)

## App structure perspective
* Finalize topic construction from the city side, use that information to determine best response forms.
